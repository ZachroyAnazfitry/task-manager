**Task 2: System Design** – Notification service (architecture, scalability, trade-offs).

*Placeholder for Task 2 answers. To be completed separately.*

## Scenario

Design a notification service that:

- Sends notifications via email, SMS, push, and in-app
- Handles 100,000+ notifications per day
- Supports scheduled notifications (send later)
- Tracks delivery status and retries failed deliveries
- Scales to 1M+ notifications per day in 6 months

*(Add your architecture diagram, components, database schema, technology stack, reliability approach, scalability strategy, and trade-offs here.)*
